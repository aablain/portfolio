            My name is Austin, and I love being creative. After High School, I Obtained my Associates Degree
            at Clark Community College in Vancouver WA. While enrolled at Clark, I took a class for HTML/CSS
            that opened my eyes to the coding world. Computers had always interested me but I never knew it was
            something I could actually do. However, after Clark I transfered to Western Oregon University to study
            Music Performance (specifically in Percussion and Drumset). After WOU, I attended a "Discipleship
            Training School" in an Orginization called YWAM, which stands for Youth With a Mission. My school in
            YWAM brought me to study for a fall in Maui, as well as 3 monthes of hands-on training all over the nation
            of Nepal. I am now attending Epicodus in Portland, Oregon in order that I might learn to code at a more
            professional level. I've always enjoyed creating in just about any medium. I believe I can use my
            creativity in the realm of coding to add something worthwhile- and if nothing else, bring a higher quality
            of life to myself and my family. I plan on learning <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, <em>Javascript</em>, and
            <em> much much more!</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from coding I have many hobbies and passions in my life. Probably the biggest in my life would be music
            and specifically drumming (if attending school for music wasn't evidence enough). I enjoy learning about music
            of all genres and how the drums are used in each. I play drumset for many churches in the Portland/Vancouver
            Metro area, as well as partake in a few music projects- some of which are on the drums, and some as
            pianist/lyricist. Like many native Pacific Northwesterners, I <strong>love</strong> to hike and explore
            the outdoors. In fact, the house I grew up in my entire life sits inside a forest in Clark County, Washington.
            Some of my fondest childhood memories took place in that forest; whacking back brush, finding trails,
            inspecting giant mushrooms that cling to trees, and almost always coming back home dirty with scraped up
            legs.

          <p>
            <span class="different">I value Honesty and Integrity.</span> I'm human so I'm not perfect- I make mistakes.
            I do my best to own up to my mistakes and shortcomings. I think that living a life of honor <em>doesn't</em>
            mean perfection, it means <em>humility and truthfulness.</em> I desire to live an honorable life.
